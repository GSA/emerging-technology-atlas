Opportunities are on the rise for public services and leading U.S. academic researcher facilities and civil society organizations to conduct and participate in research on emerging technologies in government. Our new inter-agency Academic Research Outreach initative will promote greater access to our federal programs for researchers and more open sharing of research needs in order for all to benefit from these critical contributions. 

If you are a researcher pursuing greater awareness of emerging technologies in government and would like to discuss, please email digitalgov@gsa.gov with "#Research" in the subject field.
