We understand the critical role that federal government open data plays as fuel for Artificial Intelligence innovation. We look forward to collaborating with [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/), the home of the U.S. Governmentâ€™s open data
with more than 200,000 data sets, tools, and resources, [Code.gov](https://code.gov/#/), the home of the U.S. Government's open source program, as well as the [Data Cabinet](https://ntis.gov/thedatacabinet/), the principal community of practice for data professionals from across federal government, to identify opportunities to better coordinate between federal agencies and private sector innovators to operationalize the vast wealth of federal open data. 

If you would like to contribute to this ongoing effort, please email digitalgov@gsa.gov with "#AIOpenData" in the subject field.
