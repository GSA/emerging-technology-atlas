Executives do not immediately need to invest in innovative solutions of tomorrow, but we have a responsibility to be aware of them and knowledgeable. 

A new inter-agency Venture Capital Advisory Group is established that will familiarize agencies with the venture capital community, increase opportunities to collaborate and help spread the awareness of these programs across the government. 

If you would like to participate in our Venture Capital Advisory Group please email digitalgov@gsa.gov with "#Venture" in the subject field.
