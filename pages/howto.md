Here is how you can contribute:

1. [Visit our GitHub Page](https://github.com/gsa/emerging-technology-atlas/issues/)
2. Start a new issue.
3. Label the issue with the area (e.g. Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain) followed by the corresponding number and title of the federal use case you are referencing. If you are proposing a new use case, idea, or concept, please indicate it as "New" in the label.
