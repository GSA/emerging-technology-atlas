Government managers need access to training and education programs for emerging technologies in order to prepare the federal workforce to take full advantage of opportunities to improve public services, and this means more than just training in the technology itself -- we need to increase digital literacy among all our communities, including program managers, data stewards and specialists in privacy, security and policy.

We are in the initial stages of collaborating with some of the nation's leading businesses and researchers to develop and pilot a new series of emerging technology training for the federal workforce, open to all agencies through [GSA's DigitalGov University](https://www.digitalgov.gov/digitalgov-university/), to help meet this growing need. The series of workshops and trainings will start in April 2018.

If you would like to contribute to this effort, please email digitalgov@gsa.gov with "#Training" in the subject field.
