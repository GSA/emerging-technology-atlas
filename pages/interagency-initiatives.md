Here are some of the partnerships and initiatives we work together with public services, businesses and academia on:

## Technology Modernization Fund Support

A combination of bold and innovative emerging technology solutions including Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Process Automation piloted and tested by agencies across government with the operational rigor and funding of the Technology Modernization Fund holds the potential to drive to incredible performance advancements in public services.

GSA’s Technology Modernization Fund Program Management Office (TMF PMO) and Emerging Citizen Technology Office (ECTO) are partnering to help agencies apply these advances in emerging technologies and processes to IT modernization efforts that can improve our services and reduce costs for the American people today and in the coming years.

For more information and resources, [visit our TMF support homepage.](https://emerging.digital.gov/TMF/)

Here are two informational webinars with the TMF PMO for deep dives into this program:

## Open Data for Artificial Intelligence

We understand the critical role that federal government open data plays as fuel for Artificial Intelligence innovation. We look forward to collaborating with [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/), the home of the U.S. Government’s open data
with more than 200,000 data sets, tools, and resources, [Code.gov](https://code.gov/#/), the home of the U.S. Government's open source program, as well as the [Data Cabinet](https://ntis.gov/thedatacabinet/), the principal community of practice for data professionals from across federal government, to identify opportunities to better coordinate between federal agencies and private sector innovators to operationalize the vast wealth of federal open data.

## Academic Research Outreach

Opportunities are on the rise for public services and leading U.S. academic researcher facilities and civil society organizations to conduct and participate in research on emerging technologies in government. Our new inter-agency Academic Research Outreach initative will promote greater access to our federal programs for researchers and more open sharing of research needs in order for all to benefit from these critical contributions.

If you are a researcher pursuing greater awareness of emerging technologies in government and would like to discuss, please email digitalgov@gsa.gov with “#Research” in the subject field.

## Venture Capital Community Outreach

Executives do not immediately need to invest in innovative solutions of tomorrow, but we have a responsibility to be aware of them and knowledgeable.

Our collaborations with the Venture Capital community familiarize agencies with the field, increase opportunities to collaborate and help spread the awareness of these programs across the government.

If you would like to participate in our Venture Capital activities please email digitalgov@gsa.gov with “#Venture” in the subject field.

## Workforce Training and Education

Government managers need access to training and education programs for emerging technologies in order to prepare the federal workforce to take full advantage of opportunities to improve public services, and this means more than just training in the technology itself -- we need to increase digital literacy among all our communities, including program managers, data stewards and specialists in privacy, security and policy.

We are in the initial stages of collaborating with some of the nation's leading businesses and researchers to develop and pilot a new series of emerging technology training for the federal workforce, open to all agencies through [GSA's DigitalGov University](https://www.digitalgov.gov/digitalgov-university/), to help meet this growing need. The series of workshops and trainings will start in April 2018.

If you would like to contribute to this effort, please email digitalgov@gsa.gov with "#Training" in the subject field.
