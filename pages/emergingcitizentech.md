GSA’s inter-agency Emerging Citizen Technology Office collaborates with more than 1500 federal managers at agencies and programs across government, startups, small businesses, and civic organizations to develop government-wide public service modernization initiatives through the evaluation, testing, and development of emerging technologies including:

1. [Artificial Intelligence for Citizen Services](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/emerging-citizen-technology/artificial-intelligence-for-citizen-services)
2. [Blockchain](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/emerging-citizen-technology/blockchain)
3. [Virtual and Augmented Reality](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/emerging-citizen-technology/virtual-and-augmented-reality)
4. [Social Technology](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/emerging-citizen-technology/social-technology-socialgov)

We work with experts on all aspects regarding compliant use of modern technologies--privacy, security, accessibility, transparency, accountability, and performance--and find practical use cases for their application. Here’s how it works:

1. Consult individually with federal programs across government;
2. Collect and analyze potential use cases;
3. Engage in inter-agency collaboration with our partners; then
4. Find paths to the development of shared resources for the potential adoption of the technology.

Because each mission is unique, use cases may vary between state, local, and federal agencies. The uniting factor is our public service commitment to these solutions that can better serve the American people. By sharing openly with private-sector innovators, startups, and new entries in the field, U.S. businesses gain increased transparency into the modernization of federal information technology programs.

Join our public listservs to stay informed and contribute to our latest initiatives, project wikis, and repositories.
